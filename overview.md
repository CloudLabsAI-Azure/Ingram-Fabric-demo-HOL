## Microsoft Fabric Copilot Experience for Report Building

### Overview
Copilot and other generative AI features in preview bring new ways to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI. This article introduces you to Microsoft Fabric Copilot for Reports and explains how it helps users create and refine reports using natural language. It also highlights key considerations such as data sensitivity, responsible AI usage during report generation and chart modification, and helping users better interpret report insights.

Copilot in Microsoft Fabric is a generative AI assistive technology that aims to enhance the data analytics experience in the Fabric platform for users. Copilot leverages large-language models (LLMs) that attempt to facilitate user interaction with their data and items in Fabric. People who use Copilot can include people who create, manage, and consume Fabric items, including enterprise developers, self-service users, and business users.

### Copilot in Fabric in the Power BI workload

Power BI has introduced generative AI that allows you to create reports automatically by selecting the article for a report or by prompting Copilot for Power BI on a particular article. You can use Copilot for Power BI to generate a summary for the report page that you just created, and generate synonyms for better Q&A capabilities. 

In Power BI, Copilot helps you use the transformational power of generative AI to get the most from your data. We have chat-based experiences where Copilot can help you with tasks from on-the-fly analysis for business users to data analysis expression (DAX) generation for advanced creators. We also have various AI-infused Copilot features throughout the product.

To begin exploring Microsoft Fabric Copilot for Reports, this task focuses on understanding and analyzing a sample report using natural language prompts. Copilot allows users to interact with the report by asking questions, generating summaries, and identifying trends or outliers without needing deep technical skills. This hands-on activity will help you experience how Copilot simplifies report exploration, guides interpretation of visuals, and enhances overall data comprehension through conversational AI.
